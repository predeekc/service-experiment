# Introduction

The system described here is a sample application based on the concept of independent services hosted in Docker containers.  The primary goal of this system is to explore development patters using containers and services to build distributed applications.  Some of the aspects explored are:

* Connecting containers using reverse proxies and load balancers
* Monitoring the metrics and health of services
* Authorization patterns using OAuth2
* Developing services in isolation

This document is not a set of guidance or a manual on how to build a distributed system.  It is a way to capture the results of the exploration so they can be shared across the team.  The hope is that these short essays will start a discussion and lead to improvements in the sample system and this document.
